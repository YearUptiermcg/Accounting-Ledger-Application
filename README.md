# Java Ledger Application

## Project Overview

This is a basic Java application that simulates a financial ledger system, allowing users to:
- Record deposits and payments.
- View all transactions, deposits only, or payments only.
- Generate reports for transactions based on different criteria (month-to-date, previous month, year-to-date, previous year, or by vendor).

The application saves all transactions to a `transactions.csv` file, ensuring data is saved between sessions.
